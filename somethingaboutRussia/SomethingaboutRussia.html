<p><b>1) Russians don't show their emotions</b></p>
<p>Well, some foreigners, who were in Russia for the first time, usually tell that russians are really gloomy. And this is part of the truth. Even I can be really gloomy sometimes as I'm a russian, but that doesn't matter that we aren't kind. If you ask russian for help, he or she will surely help you.</p>
<p><b>2) Russian language sounds rude</b></p>
<p>Yes, our language is amazing and really unusual for foreigner's hearing, but many people from other countries are fond of russian music with lyrics, they also find such pronounciation attractive.</p>

<p><b>3) Russian food is really strange</b></p>
<p>Even I find our meals unusual, but it's easy to cook. For example, different salads and cheesecakes (fried cottage cheese). Of course, you need to learn how to cook so that it was delicious but <i>it's worth it!</i></p>
<p><b>So that was three major stereotypes about russians but I think, the best way to check them out is to see everything with your own eyes!</b></p>
<h2>Bonus!!</h2>
<h2>Russian traditional music</h2>
<p>Actually, our modern music is different, but this one is really traditional and really russian, so enjoy!</p>
